            "5. Rejection or Obsolescence: This is the final phase in which consumers have lost interest in the style, even at discounted prices. This marks the beginning of a new cycle as consumers start seeking new styles.\n",

            "It's worth noting that the length of these cycles can vary widely and is often unpredictable. Some styles may peak and decline quickly, while others may remain in fashion for several seasons. In some cases, styles may even reappear after falling out of favor, often with modifications to suit the current trends.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are also special categories of fashion cycles, such as \"classics\" and \"fads\". Classics are styles that never completely lose their appeal and continue to be accepted for a long time. On the other hand, fads are styles that come and go quickly, usually within a single fashion season. They often lack the design strength to keep consumers interested for a long period.\n"

            "\n",
            "2. Rising Popularity: As a style gains appeal, it is often produced in different variations. The high demand leads manufacturers to make copies or variations of the original design, often at different price levels.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Peak of Popularity: At this stage, the style is in high demand and many copies or variations are produced. \n",
            "\n",
            "4. Decline in Popularity: Over time, as the number of copies increases, fashion-conscious people usually tire of the style and start looking for new styles. Retailers then often have to put these items on sale or discount to move them out and bring in something new.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Rejection or Obsolescence: This is the final phase of the fashion cycle. At this stage, consumers are no longer interested in buying the garment, even at discounted prices. They have already started looking for new styles, thus beginning a new cycle.\n",
            "\n",
            "The length of these cycles can vary greatly. Some styles may peak quickly, while others take much longer. The time a style lasts also varies, from just one season to several seasons. Some styles, known as 'classics', never completely lose their appeal and continue to be accepted for an extended period of time. On the other hand, some styles, known as 'fads', come and go within a single fashion season due to their lack of lasting appeal.\n",
            "\n",
            "The fashion cycle is not always a smooth process. There can be cycles within cycles, where a particular style remains popular but certain elements of the design change. There can also be interrupted cycles, where the progress of the fashion cycle is prematurely halted due to various factors, such as social upheaval or economic crises. In addition, some styles may reappear in a different form after a certain period, a phenomenon known as recurring cycles.\n"
